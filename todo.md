- Include .d.ts files.
- Performance measurements (use to determine effect of refactorings).

  also normalize some of the awkward type casts used in Node.
- What impact on dictionary compression when dictionary is gzipped?
- Command-line binary for building packed dictionaries.
- Split alphaCode into stand-alone library.
- NPM publication.
- Add minified (Closure) version.
- Demo hosting on github pages.
  - Performance metrics described and interactive repl like the Pageforest site.
