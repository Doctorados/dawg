# Some misc stuff to do for DAWG.

X Finish migration of PTrie!
- Include .d.ts files in lib directory.
X Add CI (CodeShip)

- Performance measurements (use to determine effect of refactorings).
- Refactor Node to use sub-objects for childNodes and terminals.  This will
  also normalize some of the awkward type casts used in Node.
- Split alphaCode into stand-alone file.
- Minified (Closure) version.
- Demo hosting on github pages.
  - Performance metrics described and interactive repl like the Pageforest site.
